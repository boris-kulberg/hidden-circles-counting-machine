Hidden-circles counting machine is a program in which I implemented my algorithm for solving a computer science problem (computational geometry visibility problem): In a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, there are arbitrary number of non-overlapping opaque circles with arbitrary radii and coordinates, and is a zero-sized observer at the origin, capable of observing only along straight lines. What is the number of circles hidden from the observer?
 
During the development of an algorithm for solving this problem, my goal was to find all hidden circles regardless of their number, quality, and location, and I encountered the need to classify the possible arrangements of hidden circles in a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system: The first group of hidden circles arrangements consists of circles hidden by a single visible circle. The second group of hidden circles arrangements consists of circles hidden by two or more visible circles. The algorithm works without losing information about which circles were hidden and which circles caused the hiding. Complexity of an algorithm is O(n^3).

After launching the program, the input system awaits data entry: the number of circles n, the radius of the first circle, the x-coordinate of the first circle, the y-coordinate of the first circle, the radius of the second circle, the x-coordinate of the second circle, the y-coordinate of the second circle, ... , the radius of the n-th circle, the x-coordinate of the n-th circle, the y-coordinate of the n-th circle.
